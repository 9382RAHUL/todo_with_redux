I successfully completed the Todo List application using Redux. To begin, I created a React app named 'TodoList'. Within this app, I developed two components: 'TaskInput' and 'TaskList', in accordance with the assignment requirements.

Next, I implemented the functionality to add and remove tasks using Redux. Using Redux allowed for a centralized state management approach, enhancing the scalability and maintainability of the application. By dispatching actions to modify the Redux store, I was able to seamlessly update the task list in response to user interactions.
